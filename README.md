What is the landscape of sex in the United States? Here we sought to illuminate this complexity by bringing together various aspects of sex and sexual health.

**IMPORTANT WHEN VIEWING VIS**
If things are loading in weird places, zoom out and try reloading the page for the viz to pop into allignment. Finally, data can take a little while to load in at the start of the page. Please take a second to breathe in, enjoy being sentient, and then click away :)

**Starting with the folders:** 

Data: Hosts all our .csv files. All data was downloaded and manually loaded. As also explained in the process book, the most comprehensive and publically released recent Center for Disease Control survey on STIs nationwide was conducted in 2012. Thus, all our data was collected from the CDC files and other sources with that specific year in mind. These were undynamic files because of their hard-coded historical values, so we did not fear our vis would suffer being "outdated" if not pulled directly from the web. Plus, downloading and converting on our own allowed us to set up the CSV files in more managable ways.

js: these are our libraries: TOPOjson, d3, jquery, and radar-chart.js. TOPOjson was used to plot the map (used pset 4 as a springboard), d3 was used for dynamic graphs,  jquery for css selectors, and radar for the radar chart. Lines 165-175 of the radar.js file were written additionally by Lucas. The rest is from the repo.

**Scripts** can be found in scripts.js, **style** in styles.css, and the **homepage** in index.html.
